# Maths
This is the repository of all the code written in my math classes, in all my schooling.

## Languages and dependencies
### Python
Most of the code is written in Python. Sometimes it requires MatPlotLib. Install-it with `pip install matplotlib`

## Scratch 3
.sb3 files are Scratch 3 files. You can run it [online](https://scratch.mit.edu) by using `Create>import from my computer`.

You can also download the scratch app and open the code with it.
